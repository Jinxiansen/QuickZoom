As [Zoom](https://zoom.us) becomes more and more popular, in our daily work, there may be many scenes where Zoom multi-person meetings are used every day. But every time you have to copy the Zoom account and password from the email, sometimes because the password contains spaces, it will cause you to be unable to join the meeting.

[QuickZoom](https://github.com/Jinxiansen/QuickZoom) can help you quickly join the Zoom meeting, reducing the tedious copy and paste, and the probability of errors when copying.

When you copy the Zoom link, you automatically join the meeting.

## How To Use

Before using this tool, please make sure you have installed the macOS version of the [Zoom app](https://zoom.us).

After you have successfully installed Zoom and QuickZoom, you can try to copy your meeting link to see what happens!
For example, when you copy the following link:

``` shell
case 1
Meeting ID: 959 1701 1534
Passcode: 744594240

case 2
https://xxx.zoom.com.cn/j/3211233218?pwd=jaYeQt-YmAITGr0D3MRTsTm6M531L2vT

case 3
https://xxx.zoom.com.cn/j/3759079899 (Passcode: 682782330)

Select the meeting ID and password, and then press Command + C to copy.

```
>  The above meeting ID and password are no longer valid, and the format is for reference only.

You will see the following interface, and then wait a moment to enter the meeting.

## Feedback

**QuickZoom** is a small tool written on a whim. From the idea to the design of the icon and the completion of the code, it took nearly a day.

Although the code is only a few hundred lines, it helped me solve the trouble of manually filling in every time I join a meeting.
